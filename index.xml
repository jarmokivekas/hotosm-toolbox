      <description>In this section covers practical data processing and analysis methods for activation size-up, planning projects, and managing ongoing projects. While these workflows are described using recent versions of QGIS, they are are typically general enough to perform in any modern GIS application (Python, R, Grass, ArcGIS etc.). This section assumes you familiar with the basic use of (HOT Export Tool](https://export.hotosm.org), (Overpass turbo)[https://overpass-turbo.eu/], and (QGIS)[https://qgis.org].
Useful QGIS plugins Installing the QuickMapServices ,Quick OSM, and OSMDownloader will make handling OSM data in QGIS more convenient.</description>

      <description>In this section, Project Managers will find example workflows from HOT projects on how the processes, tools, and workflows contained in previous sections of this Toolbox have been applied to real field projects. Project Managers can use these example workflows to identify a project similar in scope or goal to their own and identify which tools and processes may be needed for their own project. Each workflow example contains:
 An overview of the project A step-by-step guide of phases, steps, and tools used Links to various parts of the Toolbox to learn how the step was completed   There are many ways to complete a mapping project.</description>

Project Overview Open Cities Africa - Accra
The Open Cities Africa Accra project sought to make Alogboshie and its environs resilient to natural disasters, especially flooding. The project involved the remote mapping of Alogboshie, Akweteyman and Alajo. These are areas of focus in a larger resilience project, Greater Accra Resilience and Integrated Development (GARID), and are all located along the Odaw River which is prone to floods.</description>

      <description>The HOT Toolbox is designed to take a project manager or community through the entire mapping workflow, from planning, through initial mapping, data use and analysis. Not every mapping project is the same. Some projects involve extensive field data collection components, others might not even conduct field mapping activities but run desktop-based digitization projects instead.
The Toolbox has seven sections (overview below) that can be used in the order presented, or combined to suit your individual project training needs.</description>
