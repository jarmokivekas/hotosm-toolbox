<ul>
<li>An overview of Validation in JOSM, including presentation slides</li>
<li>Step-by-step instructions for practicing validation in JOSM</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The following materials are designed to assist project managers and others leading trainings and workshops. However, this material is also suitable for individuals interested in learning how to validate OSM data in JOSM.</em></p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p><strong>Validation</strong> is a process of checking the data quality (in this case, map data quality) for accuracy, consistency, completeness and anomaly. Validation is important to maintain the quality of OSM data. When checking for accuracy, you need to make sure that the map data is aligned with the imagery and is correct in terms of geometry. For consistency, make sure that all mapped objects are consistent in shape. For example, when you found a residential area, make sure all the buildings are consistently traced and orthogonalized.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_1.png" alt="Example of data validation" title="example of data validation"></p>
<p>For completeness, it depends on what information you want to collect when mapping and what mapping method is used. Information collected using remote mapping method would be different with the information collected by conducting field survey. Information collected using remote mapping method will be very limited since you only have satellite imagery and gpx tracks available as reference. For anomaly, make sure there is no abnormal looking mapped objects. See the picture below, the mapped buildings on the left tends to be smaller than the mapped buildings on the right. After carefully checking the imagery, it turns out that the smaller buildings are actually tombs that are mapped as buildings.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_1.png" alt="Example of data completeness" title="example of data completeness"></p>
<p>While light validation can be completed using iD Editor, HOT recommends that detailed validation be completed using JOSM.</p>

<p><strong>Estimated time for completion:</strong> 1 hour</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To be able to understand validation process for OSM data</li>
<li>To be able to perform validation using Validation Tools on JOSM</li>
<li>To be able to fix commonly error, warning and mistake found during validation</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1. Opening OSM Data</strong></p>
<p>After successfully downloaded sample data, open file <strong>validation_sample.osm</strong> into your JOSM by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click menu <strong>File</strong> ‚ûù <strong>Open</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_5.png" alt="JOSM Menu File" title="JOSM Menu File"></p>

<p><strong>2. Using JOSM Validation Tools</strong></p>
<p>JOSM provides a built-in validator that checks and fixes invalid map data called Validation Tools. After checking for accuracy, consistency, completeness and anomaly, run this validation tools so that the map data is perfectly valid. To get started with the Validation tools, you need to activate the Validation Results Windows by following these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click menu <strong>Windows</strong> ‚ûù <strong>Validation Results</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_3.png" alt="Windows menu on JOSM" title="Windows Menu on JOSM"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>Validation results Windows will appear on the left side of your JOSM</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_4.png" alt="Validation results Windows" title="Validation results Windows"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>After activating the Validation Results Windows, now you can start validation using JOSM Validation Tools. Download OSM data first using either Slippy Map or Tasking Mananger, then you can click the Validation button in the Validation Results Windows. Let‚Äôs use <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13QgUDeoBA7uLSUkjsK8cEFsadmjpbNg_/view">OSM data sample</a> for exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li>To run validation on all the data in the current data layer, which is validation_sample.osm, make sure that there is no data selected. Then, click <strong>Validation</strong> button in the Validation Results Windows. Once the validation process is finished, Validation Results Windows will be filled with listed errors and warnings. The amount of errors and warnings found depends on the quality of the data. For example, on this OSM data sample, you will find one error and twenty one warnings.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_8.png" alt="Validation Results  from OSM Data Sample" title="Validation Results  from OSM Data Sample"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ul>
<li>A new layer called Validation errors will also be added to the Layers Windows. This layer will highlight the errors and warnings found - red highlight for errors and yellow highlight for warnings.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_9.png" alt="Highlighted errors and warnings" title="Highlighted errors and warnings"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>3. Fixing Errors and Warnings</strong></p>
<p>Errors are important to fix. Do not ignore errors. If you have errors on your OSM data, you won‚Äôt be able to upload it into OSM Server until you fix the errors. Some errors can be fixed automatically using the Fix button on Validation Results Windows. Warnings are problems that are important to fix, but in some cases, such as ‚ÄúUnnamed Ways‚Äù, they are tolerable. Mostly, warning should be fixed manually. Now, let‚Äôs try to fix errors and warnings found on <em>validation_sample.osm</em>. There are one error and twenty one warnings found on <em>validation_sample.osm</em>. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Error: Duplicated ways (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Building inside building (4)</li>
<li>Warning: Crossing building/highway (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Crossing buildings (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Crossing highways (1)</li>
<li>Warning: deprecated tagging - amenity=hotel is deprecated, use tourism=hotel instead (1)</li>
<li>Warning: missing tag - incomplete object: only name (1)</li>
<li>Warning: node connects highway and building (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Overlapping highways (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Unclosed way - building (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Unnamed ways (6)</li>
<li>Warning: Untagged ways (1)</li>
<li>Warning: Way end node near other highway (2)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let‚Äôs fix all the errors and warnings one by one.</p>
<p><strong>3.1 Fixing Error: Duplicated ways</strong></p>
<p>Duplicated ways error come up when there are ways that duplicate. This is usually caused by unstable internet connection when uploading OSM data into OSM server. Initially, to fix errors or warning, you should select the error or warning you want to fix. Go to the Duplicated ways error in the Validation Result Windows, click the <strong>+</strong> icon so that it looks like the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_10.png" alt="Duplicated objects on Validation Results" title="Duplicated objects on Validation Results"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Select the objects where it is duplicated and <strong>Right-click</strong> ‚ûù <strong>Zoom to problem</strong> to zoom and see the duplicated objects. Your map canvas will zoom in to the duplicated objects. Fortunately, duplicated ways can be automatically fixed. After selecting the duplicated objects, click <strong>Fix</strong>. Voila, your error is fixed!</p>

<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_13.png" alt="Zooming to Warning: Building inside building" title="Zooming to Warning: Building inside building"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Most of warning should be fixed manually. To fix building inside building, simply delete one of the buildings. To decide which one to be deleted, please take a look at the imagery and carefully decide which one to be deleted. Voila, you just fixed a building inside building.</p>

<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_22.png" alt="Zooming to Warning: Crossing highways" title="Zooming to Warning: Crossing highways"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To fix crossing highways, simply add a crossing node in the highway intersection. To add node at intersection, you can use JOSM additional tools, but first you have to activate plugin utilsplugins2. You can go to menu **Preferences **‚ûù <strong>Plugins</strong>, search for utilsplugins2 and give a check for utilsplugin2.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_23.png" alt="Activating plugin utilsplugins2" title="Activating plugin utilsplugins2"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>To add node at intersection, select the two crossing highways, and go to menu <strong>More tools</strong> ‚ûù <strong>Add nodes at intersections</strong>. And voila, your crossing highways now have a crossing node.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_24.png" alt="Adding node at intersection" title="Adding node at intersection"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>3.6 Fixing Warning: deprecated tagging</strong></p>
<p>Deprecated tagging warning come up when there is an object or more in your OSM data that used deprecated tagging. To fix it, go to  the deprecated tagging warning in the Validation Results Windows, click the <strong>+</strong> icon so that it looks like the picture below.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_25.png" alt="Deprecated tagging on Validation Results" title="Deprecated tagging on Validation Results"></p>

<p>Select the objects listed under the warning deprecated tagging and <strong>Right-click</strong> ‚ûù <strong>Zoom to problem</strong> to zoom and see the objects. Your map canvas will zoom in to the objects.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_26.png" alt="Zooming to Warning: deprecated tagging" title="Zooming to Warning: deprecated tagging"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Fortunately, deprecated tagging can be fixed automatically using Fix button. After selecting the object that has deprecated tagging, press the **Fix **button. JOSM will automatically change the deprecated tag into the new one.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_27.png" alt="Fixing deprecated tagging" title="Fixing deprecated tagging"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><strong>3.7 Fixing Warning: missing tag</strong></p>

<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_29.png" alt="Zooming to Warning: missing tag" title="Zooming to Warning: missing tag"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>In this case, the object ‚ÄúMonrovia Park‚Äù only has tag name. It does not have the tag that identify it as park. What you have to do is simply add a tag to define that it is a park, named Monrovia Park. To add tag, click menu <strong>Presets</strong> ‚ûù <strong>Search preset‚Ä¶</strong> and search for Park. Select one that suits the kind of park you map, in this case you can select Geography/Landuse/Park, then click <strong>Select</strong>.

<p><strong>3.11 Fixing Warning: Unnamed ways</strong></p>
<p>Unnamed ways warning come up when there is one or more highways (main road) that do not have names. This warning is one of the tolerable warning, so you can just ignore this. If you know the name of the road, you can add the road‚Äôs name by adding tag name to the road. However, if you do not know the name, please just leave it as is rather than giving a random name that could be misleading. To ignore this warning, you can just leave it as is or you can also put it on your Ignore list so that this warning does not come up when you perform validation in the future. Click the ‚ÄúUnnamed Ways‚Äù warning in the warning list, then click <strong>Ignore</strong> and click <strong>Whole Group</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/validation/validation_42.png" alt="Putting a warning into Ignore List" title="Putting a warning into Ignore List"></p>
